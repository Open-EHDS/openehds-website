People do not need a perfect roadmap to trust a project. They need a credible one that explains sequence, scope, and current focus.

## What the public roadmap should do

It should show where the foundation is concentrating effort now, what is coming next, and how partners can align with the delivery window.

That visibility makes early collaboration easier and reduces uncertainty before the first large release.
