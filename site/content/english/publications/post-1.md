OpenEHDS Foundation is intentionally organized around reusable software assets because delivery teams need stable building blocks more than they need another abstract concept deck.

The public website reflects that decision: programs, publications, and resources are all framed as support for actual implementation work.

## What the first wave should include

The first repository wave can focus on a reference application core, interoperability tooling, and deployment-ready supporting assets.

> Reusable software lowers the cost of alignment for every future partner.

That is why the foundation website must look less like a simple landing page and more like an operating platform.
