The public root URL exists as a neutral gateway so both language versions can live in explicit subfolders without ambiguity.

## Why that matters

This approach keeps links predictable, gives both language spaces equal weight, and makes later automation or language detection easier to introduce.

For a public foundation site, clarity at the root is often more valuable than clever redirection.
