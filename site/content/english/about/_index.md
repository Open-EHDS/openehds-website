OpenEHDS Foundation is being shaped as a practical home for EHDS-related open source software. The goal is to make reusable software, implementation assets, and public-facing guidance easier to discover, evaluate, and adopt.

## What the foundation publishes

* open source software for EHDS-aligned services
* implementation patterns and delivery assets
* technical publications and practical notes
* roadmap signals for partners and contributors
* a clear public entry point to the GitHub organization

## Core Team

The core team owns the public roadmap, release framing, and stewardship of the most important software and implementation assets. In the first release of the site, this section uses placeholder profiles that can later be replaced with final bios.

## Contributors

Contributors include implementation partners, subject matter experts, maintainers, and collaborators helping shape the software, documentation, and adoption model.

## Open source presence

* GitHub organization: [Open-EHDS on GitHub](https://github.com/Open-EHDS)
* Repository placeholder: implementation-core (URL to be confirmed)
