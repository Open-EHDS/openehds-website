The Community page is the public entry point for people who want to follow, support, or contribute to the initiative.

## Who this is for

* software contributors
* implementation partners
* subject matter experts
* institutions evaluating collaboration

## What to expect

The first version is intentionally concise. It establishes the collaboration model now and can expand later with working groups, contributor pathways, and governance notes.
