This page is a launch placeholder and should be replaced with the final privacy policy before public release.

## What the final version should cover

1. contact data handling
2. analytics decisions
3. publication subscriptions, if added later
4. repository and third-party link handling
5. user rights and data retention

## Current state

No production data collection workflow is enabled in this placeholder deployment beyond the static site itself and optional contact form wiring to be configured later.
