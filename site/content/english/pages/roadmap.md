The public roadmap gives people enough signal to understand sequencing and confidence levels.

1. finalize the foundation's public-facing structure
2. publish the first software and repository references
3. release initial technical publications and contextual materials
4. open a clearer contributor and partner intake flow

This roadmap is a placeholder, but it is intentionally specific enough to feel credible.
