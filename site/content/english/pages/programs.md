The Programs section explains where the foundation is concentrating effort. It is intentionally structured like a real operating model, even while some details remain placeholder content.

## Software Core

This track is where reusable EHDS-related software is shaped, documented, and prepared for public consumption.

## Implementation Assets

This track groups templates, technical notes, operational patterns, and supporting material that make the software easier to adopt.

## Adoption and Partner Enablement

This is the public-facing layer for implementation partners, public institutions, and delivery teams who need context before committing to deeper collaboration.
