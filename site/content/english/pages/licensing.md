This page summarizes how licensing is handled for the public OpenEHDS.org website.

## Scope

The website contains three different categories of material:

1. source code, templates, and technical configuration
2. third-party components and libraries
3. editorial content published by the foundation

These categories do not all share one single license.

## Third-party components

The website is built on top of external open source components that keep their upstream licenses.

Main examples currently used in this service:

* [Hugoplate](https://github.com/zeon-studio/hugoplate) - MIT
* [Hugo Modules by GetHugoThemes](https://github.com/gethugothemes/hugo-modules) - upstream MIT
* [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) - Apache-2.0
* [Swiper](https://github.com/nolimits4web/swiper) - MIT
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/download) - licensing depends on the asset type and upstream package terms

Where an upstream component includes its own license, notice, or attribution requirements, those upstream terms apply.

## Foundation editorial content

Unless a specific page states otherwise, original editorial content published by OpenEHDS Foundation in this website is intended to be shared under:

* `CC BY 4.0`

That means the content may be copied, shared, and adapted, including for public reuse, as long as proper attribution to the source is preserved.

Recommended attribution format:

* `Source: OpenEHDS Foundation, openehds.org`

## Exclusions

The content license does not automatically cover:

* OpenEHDS logos
* OpenEHDS name and brand identifiers
* trademarks
* third-party materials that may appear under separate terms

These elements remain subject to their own legal status unless explicitly stated otherwise.
