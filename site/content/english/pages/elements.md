{{< toc >}}

This page intentionally keeps the richer demo mechanics of the original theme, but reframes them as a toolkit preview for future implementation materials.

## What this page demonstrates

It shows how the foundation can publish structured guidance, reusable snippets, warnings, notes, and technical walkthroughs without adding a separate CMS.

## Example notice

{{< notice "info" >}}
This is a placeholder notice for implementation guidance, release notes, or interoperability caveats.
{{< /notice >}}

## Example delivery checklist

1. Publish the software scope.
2. Define the implementation constraints.
3. Link to the relevant repository.
4. Add release status and adoption guidance.

## Example tabs

{{< tabs >}}
{{< tab "Software" >}}

The foundation can use this layout for software overviews, release intent, and short repository context.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Guidance" >}}

The same page structure can host implementation notes, checklists, and operational clarifications.

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Adoption" >}}

This is where partner-facing onboarding content, constraints, and next steps can live.
